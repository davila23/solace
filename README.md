# Solace Healthcare Advocates Platform: Technical Improvements



https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1e60a372-4ea5-49c4-8017-6439e489f423



## Project Overview

For this assignment, I transformed a basic healthcare advocate directory into a production-ready, scalable platform with enterprise-grade architecture and features. I approached this task as a senior developer would: analyzing the existing codebase for issues, implementing best practices, and building a solution that could handle real-world requirements.

## 🔍 Initial Assessment & Solutions Implemented

Upon reviewing the original codebase, I identified several critical issues that would prevent the application from scaling:

1. **Client-side filtering** of all records would fail with large datasets
2. **Direct DOM manipulation** in a React app violated core principles
3. **Missing pagination** would cause performance issues with large datasets
4. **No authentication system** limited administrative capabilities
5. **Minimal error handling** would lead to poor user experience

To address these issues, I completely restructured the application following Next.js best practices and implemented a robust set of features.

## 🏗️ Architecture Implementation

I rebuilt the architecture following a clear separation of concerns, implementing a layered structure that enhances maintainability and scalability:

```
src/
├── app/                # Next.js App Router with routes
├── components/         # Reusable UI components
├── services/           # Business logic layer
├── repositories/       # Data access layer
├── lib/                # Core utilities
├── middleware.ts       # Request processing
└── db/                 # Database configuration
```

This architecture follows the official Next.js recommendations for large-scale applications, ensuring the codebase remains maintainable as it grows.

## 🚀 Key Features Implemented

### Enterprise-Grade Scalability

I transformed the simple prototype into a platform capable of handling hundreds of thousands of records:

- **Server-side Pagination**: Implemented an efficient limit/offset pagination system to fetch only necessary records, replacing the original approach that loaded all data at once
- **Backend Filtering**: Moved all filtering logic to the server-side, eliminating client-side performance bottlenecks
- **Optimized Database Queries**: Created properly indexed queries with JOINs where needed
- **API Query Parameters**: Implemented support for search, filtering, and pagination parameters

### Robust Authentication & Authorization

I built a complete auth system to secure the application:

- **JWT-based Authentication**: Implemented secure token-based authentication
- **Role-based Access Control**: Created distinct user roles (admin/user) with appropriate permissions
- **Protected Routes**: Used Next.js middleware to secure admin routes
- **Session Management**: Implemented secure login/logout flows with proper token handling

### Client-Side Data Management

I implemented SWR for more efficient data handling:

- **SWR Library Integration**: Added Stale-While-Revalidate pattern for data fetching
- **Automatic Data Refresh**: Data refreshes when users return to the application
- **Cached Responses**: Reduces redundant network requests and improves performance
- **Loading States**: Properly indicates when data is being loaded
- **Error States**: Shows clear error messages when data fetching fails

The admin role can now create and manage advocate profiles, providing a complete management solution.

### API Security & Optimization

I secured and optimized all API endpoints:

- **Input Validation**: Added comprehensive validation for all API inputs
- **Error Handling**: Implemented consistent error responses
- **Route Protection**: Secured sensitive endpoints with middleware
- **Swagger Documentation**: Added automatic API documentation

### Enhanced User Experience

I completely redesigned the frontend for better usability:

- **Modern UI Components**: Built reusable components with proper state management
- **Loading States**: Added visual feedback during data loading
- **Error Handling**: Implemented user-friendly error messages
- **Responsive Design**: Ensured the application works on all device sizes
- **Accessibility**: Added proper ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation

### Quality Assurance

I implemented a testing framework to ensure code quality:

- **Unit Tests**: Created tests for core business logic and services
- **Integration Tests**: Added tests for API endpoints
- **Test Coverage**: Ensured critical paths were covered

## 💡 Technical Decisions & Best Practices

- **Repository Pattern**: Implemented to separate data access from business logic
- **Service Layer**: Created to encapsulate complex operations
- **Custom React Hooks**: Developed for reusable frontend logic
- **TypeScript**: Used throughout for type safety and better developer experience
- **JSDoc Documentation**: Added comprehensive code documentation

## 🧪 Testing & Quality Assurance

I believe quality assurance is essential for production applications, so I implemented:

- Unit tests for core services
- API integration tests
- Frontend component tests
- ESLint configuration for code quality

## 🚦 Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start PostgreSQL using Docker
docker compose up -d

# Create a .env file with your database connection
# Make sure DATABASE_URL is set correctly
# Example: DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:password@localhost/solaceassignment

# Setup database (generates schema and seeds data)
npm run db:setup

# Or run each step separately if needed:
# npm run db:generate    # Generate database schema
# npm run db:seed        # Seed the database with initial data

# Start development server
npm run dev
```
